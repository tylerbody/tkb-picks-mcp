      description: `Check how often a player has cleared a specific stat line across their recent games.

This pulls the player's team's recent finalized games and reads the player's actual
stat value from each one, so the result is a REAL counted sample - never a fixed
window and never padded/estimated. Games where the player didn't play (DNP/inactive)
are excluded from the count, not treated as a miss.

Args:
  - sport, teamID, playerID, playerName, statID, line, direction
  - lookbackGames (default 10): how many recent games to pull before DNP filtering

Returns: gamesConsidered (true sample size), gamesHit, gamesExcludedDNP, the full
game-by-game log, and SEASON PROVENANCE - how many counted games came from the
current season vs a prior one, plus a warning when the sample crosses that boundary.

WHY SEASON PROVENANCE MATTERS: the lookback window is a rolling date range, so early
in a season it reaches back into the previous one. A hit rate built entirely on last
season's games is NOT current form, and writing it up as though it were is misleading.
When the warning fires, either report only current-season games or say "last season"
explicitly in the reasoning bullet. This matters most in NFL Weeks 1-3 and for any
player who changed teams, role, or scheme in the offseason.

Examples:
  - Use when: "How often has Semien gone over 0.5 hits lately?" -> statID="batting_hits", line=0.5, direction="over"
  - Don't use when: you need the CURRENT odds for this prop - use tkb_get_odds instead
  - Don't use when: you don't have the player's SGO teamID/playerID yet - get those from tkb_get_odds first

Error Handling:
  - If gamesConsidered is 0, all recent games were DNP - flag this rather than reporting a hit rate
  - Report gamesExcludedDNP explicitly so it's clear the sample size reflects only games actually played
  - If seasonWarning is non-null, do NOT present the number as current-season form`,
