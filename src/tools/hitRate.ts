      description: `Check how often a player has cleared a specific stat line across their recent games.

This pulls the player's team's recent finalized games and reads the player's actual
stat value from each one, so the result is a REAL counted sample - never a fixed
window and never padded/estimated. Games where the player didn't play (DNP/inactive)
are excluded from the count, not treated as a miss.

Args:
  - sport, teamID, playerID, playerName, statID, line, direction
  - lookbackGames (default 10): how many recent games to pull before DNP filtering

Returns: gamesConsidered (true sample size), gamesHit, gamesExcludedDNP, and the
full game-by-game log.

Examples:
  - Use when: "How often has Semien gone over 0.5 hits lately?" -> statID="batting_hits", line=0.5, direction="over"
  - Don't use when: you need the CURRENT odds for this prop - use tkb_get_odds instead
  - Don't use when: you don't have the player's SGO teamID/playerID yet - get those from tkb_get_odds first

Error Handling:
  - If gamesConsidered is 0, all recent games were DNP - flag this rather than reporting a hit rate
  - Report gamesExcludedDNP explicitly so it's clear the sample size reflects only games actually played`,
